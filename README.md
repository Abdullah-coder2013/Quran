## About 

This is a website of reading the Quran page by page and surah by surah.<br/>
It is not just any Quran app, it is like reading the book digitaly.<br/>
I had this idea when I was looking for Quran apps like this one.<br/>
Unfortunately I couldn't find any, so I thought: "Maybe I can make one"<br/>
And then, the development started.<br/>
